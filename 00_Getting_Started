Getting Started.

Git is great.    Git is good.    Git is powerful.

Alas, that makes it a little daunting getting started.   This document should
help make it a little less painful.  Git is powerful and hopefully you will
find it is worth the effort.

This document is written assuming that you will be using github to contribute
to the TinyProd TinyOS repository structure.

* Why Git?

The main reason behind the selection of GIT is it's fully distributed nature,
fast branching, and associated merge magic.  The TinyOS development community
is essentially world wide and we want to make encourage the rate of development
by making the contribution process very easy as well as accessable.

  o Fully distributed.

  o Everything is local.   No need of a centralized server for anything.
    (note our workflow does require integration repositories but this isn't
    implicit in GIT), nor does it impact the contribution process.

  o Cheap local branching.  This is important.  We want to foster faster
    development.  Try something out while still staying in touch with what
    is happening in the mainline.  This is much more difficult with rTinyOS's
    (research TinyOS) CVS contrib and SVN based repositories.

    Note, branching in GIT is fundamentally different than pretty much any
    other SCM system and is responsbile for much of the productivity of projects
    using GIT.

  o GITHUB.  When coupled with github, git provides very powerful visibility tools
    (what is being changed and by whom).  Code review becomes very easy when
    using GIT and github.

  o Git is Small

  o Git is Fast

  o Support for any workflow.  Although we are using the Integration Manager
    Workflow.   This also promotes code review.

  o Allows gradual reintegration of currently active contrib source bodies.
    Currently the contrib source body is maintained in CVS and is rather
    cumbersome to use.   Bringing active contrib code into the TinyProd
    github realm would provide the same mechanism for accessing and using
    active contrib code as the main TinyOS body.

    Using TinyProd hosted contrib code would be as simple as merging two
    git branches or possibly two branches in different git repositories.

  o Other DVCS could also have been chosen (SVN is not a DVCS), such as Hg
    or Bzr but I happened to be a fan of GIT.   And it seems to be working
    well for what we are trying to do.


* GitHub

* We use github to host the repository.   And they have very good help files
  that will assist you in getting set up.

* Go to github.com and get yourself a logon.  Choose your login name
  carefully.   You can rename it once (but only once).
  
  Once you are logged in, You'll be presented a start up page which
  includes things like "Set Up Git", "Create a Repository", "Fork a
  Repository", etc.   We will be using existing repositories.


* Set Up Git.

  This section details items that only need to be when first getting started.
  For more information on using git and contributing to the project please
  see 00a_Contribution_Process.

 o set up SSH keys.  If you have an existing SSH key you can use it.
   Existing keys can typically be found in ~/.ssh.   The instructions have
   you backup and remove and then regenerating a new ssh key.  You don't
   need to do that but can use your existing key if you wish.  For
   example: you could use ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub as your key.

 o Set your username and email

   $ git config --global user.name "Firsname Lastname"
   $ git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

 o Set your GitHub token.

   Follow the instructions on the github help page (Set Up Git).


* Other things to put into your git config.   (global for the user,
  which lives at ~/.gitconfig)

  o To avoid problems with DOS EOL sequences, we always store in the
    repository using UNIX EOL sequences.   Set autocrlf to input to
    avoid these problems.

    $ git config --global core.autocrlf input

  o It is handy to set up local copies of remote branches automatically.

    $ git config --global branch.autosetupmerge true

  o And when pushing handy to push only the current branch (the most common
    activity).

    $ git config --global push.default current

  o It is really handy to define various aliases for common commands.

    $ git config --global alias.b branch
    $ git config --global alias.ci commit

    will define two aliases, b for branch and ci for commit.  You can do
    things like:

    $ git b                   # display current branch
    $ git ci                  # same as git commit


An example ~/.gitconfig looks like:  (Its mine with the github token
redacted)...

[user]
	name = Eric B. Decker
	email = cire831@gmail.com
[core]
	editor = emacsclient
	autocrlf = input
[alias]
	b  = branch
	br = branch
	c  = config
	ci = commit
	co = checkout
	cp = cherry-pick
	d  = diff
	lp = log -p
	r  = remote
	rem= remote
	st = status
	s  = status
	wc = whatchanged
[branch]
	autosetupmerge = true
[pack]
	threads = 0
[push]
	default = current
[github]
	user = cire831
	token = xxxxxxxxxx


* Set up your working repository

  See 00_Repo_Notes for the structure of the repositories and their
  relationships.

  Also see 00a_Contribution_Process for examples of how to interacte with the
  various branches and repositories.

  The main repo is https://github.com/tinyprod/prod with an integration repo
  at https://github.com/tp-freeforall/prod.  (The later is a fork off
  tinyprod/prod).

  Contributors work in a local repo linked to a working github repo that is
  forked from tp-freeforall/prod.  This keeps a fair amount of independence
  between different developers.

  Contributors work initially on a contributor branch in their local
  repository.  When a contributor is happy with the work they have done,
  they will integrate their changes into a local copy of the integration
  branch.   This integration branch is pushed back to the contributor's
  github fork and a request for a pull is made between the contributor's
  branch and the main integration branch.

  Please refer to 00a_Contribution_Process for details on how to set up
  your working repository.


* Further Reading

  o GitHub Help
    (http://help.github.com)

    GitHub has lots of help.  The TinyProd structure is a bit more
    complicated than what is presented in the help files.   So keep
    that in mind when working through the examples.

  o Main Git Site, Documentation
    (http://git-scm.com/documentation)

  o Git Reference
    (http://gitref.org)

  o Git from the bottom up.
    (http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/git.from.bottom.up.pdf)

    Is an easy to understand description of how git works from the bottom up.

  o Pro Git is a book about git that is very good.
    (http://progit.org)

  o Distributed Git
    (http://progit.org/book/ch5-0.html)

    This chapter talks about using Git as part of a distributed workflow.  It
    gives a good foundation about how we are managing the TinyProd repository.

    In particular, please read Integration-Manger Workflow (its what we are
    using).   And we have added one more repository to the left of the
    Blessed Repository which is VeryBlessed.  :-)   [VeryBlessed is the
    github:TinyProd/prod repository].

    Also please read, Contributing to a Project.   Some of what is written there
    is also summarized in the Guidelines section below.


* Guidelines

* Commit guidelines.

  o First and foremost make commits logical units.

    Logically seperate changesets.   Don't code for weeks and then bring the
    whole piece in as one commit.

    Make a commit something that can be looked at and digested reasonably.
    Solves one problem.

    Keep the history clean and understandable.


  o Use meaningful commit messages.

    the first line (50 chars or less) is used as the short message.   This
    message is displayed in one line logs and other places.  Make it
    meaningful and concise if possible.

    Follow the first line by a blank line then a more detailed message which
    should provide more detailed information about what the commit does.  The
    GIT project itself requires motivation as well as contrasting the new
    behaviour to old behaviour.  Why was this change necessary?  Its not a
    bad habit to get into when it makes sense to do so.

  o Use the imperative present tense when writing commit messages.

  o Always include a blank line after the short message (the first line).

  o Always run git diff --check to make sure you aren't introducing trailing
    whitespace.   Some tools bitch about this and it is really annoying.


* Copyright.

  The main TinyOS code is copyrighted by individual authors using the 3 clause
  Modified BSD license.   The simplest thing to do is either use no copyright
  or use the BSD license.

  We are trying to get any new code to use the same boilerplate license.   The
  intent is to minimize any extraneous noise when generating diffs.   The
  boilerplate is written so the only part that needs to be modified as new
  authors are added is the actually Copyright (c) <year> <name> clause at
  the front.

  A template for this copyright can be found in $(TOSROOT)/licenses/bsd.txt.
  

* coding style.   These are suggestions.   There isn't a style nazi.

    TinyProd is directly downstream from the academic TinyOS SVN trunk.  As such
    most of the coding style is adapted to be consistent with that repository.
    Some changes have been made to keep the code as compact as possible.

  o Indent:2

    if ( a == b) {
      c = d;
    }

  o Braces: same line  (see above), closing brace by itself.

  o single provides/uses: same line, multiple blocked.

    module xyz {
      provides interface NameInterface as NI;
      uses     interface AnotherInterface as AI;
    }

    module abc {
      provides {
        interface NameInterface as NI;
	interface AnotherInterface as AI;
      }
      uses {
        interface Inter1;
	interface Inter2;
      }
      implementation {
        ...
      }

  o if then else

    if ( a == b)
      <then clause>
    else
      <else clause>

    if ( a == b) {
       block statements
    } else {
       block statements
    }
