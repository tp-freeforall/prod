I2C test app for use with cc430f5137, this app give a very simple CLI on the serial port and allows you to test the I2C bus,
The test circuit includes a microchip 24lv1025 I2C eeprom, pull up resistors are 4.7k on both SCL & SDA.
The 24lc1025 has pins 1&2 held low and pin 3 high.

serial setup is default , 115K 8,n,1
I2C is 7 bit master running at ~100khz

from the command line commands are

1. 'hi' the CLI simply returns the text 'hello back'
2. 'testsend' writes 'ABCDEFG' to the eeprom at address 0x0050
3. 'testset' set the eeprom address to 0x0050
4. 'testrec' read 7 bytes 'ABCDEFG' from the current address (if you comment out the line in testrec the address is set before read)
