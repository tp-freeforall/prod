Welcome to TinyProd

* About TinyProd:

TinyProd is a GIT based TinyOS repository that is immediately downstream from
the main SVN based TinyOS repository that is maintained by the academic TinyOS
community.

TinyProd is intended to be a more vibrant, developer/production orientated
repository.  Some of the features include:

  o organize git based TinyOS development.
  o More vibrant, higher rate of change for the community.
  o Encourage collaboration
  o Optimize developer resources.  (Streamline the development process).
    Developer centric rather than academic centric.
  o Peer driven code review, norm rather than the exception.
  o real issue and bug tracking
  o tracking changes to TinyProd managed pieces of the source tree
    and linking to appropriate tracking documents.
  o stable mainline.
  o Continuous release cycle.

The intent is to keep the structure as simple as possible while allowing
for reasonable levels of contribution.   We want a forum where developers
can make their code easily accessible, mechanisms for real code review and
feedback, and a reasonable level of stability in the releases.

The assumption is that developer resources are scarce and should be optimized
while still maintaining good development practices.

If a developer takes the time to put a reasonable piece of code together, gets
it reviewed, then they should have a place where it can live and contribute
to the mainline.   The critical resource for getting development done is the
developers time and effort.   We should be making their life easier and
providing a mechanism for their code to become part of the whole.

If you have something to contribute we will find a reasonable way to get it
published and easy to find as part of the TinyOS community.


* Msp430 Toolchain:

The initial major feature of the TinyProd repository is the creation of a more
complete TI Msp430 core.   This requires use of an updated TI msp430 toolchain.
The new toolchain is being worked on by Peter Bigot and is in active development
and needs to be verified.   While this repository supports old TI processors (x1
family) its primary focus is on the newer processors which requires the newer
toolchain.   The intent is that all processors (original, x1 as well as the newer
x2 and x5 families) should be tested with the newer toolchain.

An interium tarball of an installed toolchain can be found at
http://tinyprod.net/downloads/msp430-20110716.tgz.   It should be installed in root (/).
Additional packages (libmpc-dev libmpc2) need to be installed as they are needed by
the toolchain to function correctly.

Debian packages are being built for Ubuntu Oneiric (11.10).

Some testing with the old 3.2.3 toolchain (original tinyos and z1 varient) has
also been done for basic functionality (ie. does it compile).


* Repo Structure

github.com/tinyprod/prod: main TinyProd repo.
  The VeryBlessed repo.  Holds the stable mainline (master).   Releases
  come off this repo and the master branch.

github.com/tp-freeforall/prod: working fork.
  Blessed repo.  Holds consolidated integration branches and
  proposed updates.

github.com/<github_user>/prod: user's tinyprod working fork.
  branched off tp-freeforall/prod.   working branches
  should be branched off the tp-freeforall/prod(branch)
  that the user is working on.

The general form for a repository/branch is: <github_context>/<repo>(branch)
ie. tp-freeforall/prod(msp430-int-pu) is the msp430-int-pu branch in the
tp-freeforall/prod repository.

Local repositories are referenced using local(branch).   local(remote/branch).


Also see 00_Getting_Started and 00a_Contribution_Process for more details on
getting started and using git to contribute.



main persistent branches:

svn/upstream: svn tinyos tracking branch.

master: the main tinyprod release line.
next:   integration branch for next release on master.
pu:     integration branch for proposed updates.

<feature>-int: integration branch for feature
<feature>-int-pu: proposed update.
<feature>-int-next: accepted updates.

(some of these branches may be skipped depending on need).




Other current branches:

msp430-int: msp430 integration (msp430 core, x1, x2, x5) feature branch

msp430-int-pu: proposed updates to msp430-int (no msp430-int-next).

swreset: potential msp430 swreset implementation.

motenet-rel: replacement for the serialforwarder.   Adds AF_AM sockets and
  a socket interface to the serial stack.

svn-vhsb: remove bad z1 commit from svn trunk

(note: tinyprod's master branch will eventually consist of a merge between
msp430-int, svn-vhsb, swreset, and motenet-rel).



user branches are working branches in user working forks.  ie.

    local(msp430-int-pu)	refers to the msp430-int-pu branch in the
				local working repository.

    github:roberthunter/prod(rh) refers to the branch rh (a developer branch)
				 in the developer repository at github.

* Branches:

svn/upstream: is the main branch coming from the svn t2 mainline.  Updated manually.

svn-vhsb: (vogon hyper-spatial bypass)  Bypass the Z1 commits on the main
	trunk.  This branch tracks master but has the superfluous Z1 commit
	removed as it conflicts with the collapsed msp430 x2xxx work done in
	mm_core.  This collapsage forms the majority of the work of merging
	the trees and there isn't much sense in reinventing the wheel.

msp430-int: main integration branch for the msp430 core.   It represents the
	current released version of the branch.

	includes all three major families (x1, x2, and x5).  Major cpu dependancies
	held in tos/chips/msp430/{x1xxx,x2xxx,x5xxx}

msp430-int-pu: new proposed changes to msp430-int are first integrated here.
	When verified these get merged into msp430-int.
